description "The vegetable garden wasn't doing well. When I found my cucumber plants defoliated, I blamed the woodchuck who had a burrow behind our garage. I had caught him chomping on the leaves that stuck out of the fence and figured he'd found a way into the garden. A week later, though, I found bite marks on the green tomatoes and an unmistakable pile of evidence on the grass. Damn. The deer used to leave me alone. The front yard had its own problems. A vine I couldn't identify had invaded the park and was trying to overtake my yard, too. Every week I had to pull out new intruders. On a hot August Saturday, I grabbed my work gloves and trowel and went on the attack. As I yanked on vine after vine, I cursed the deer. Why couldn't they eat this stuff instead of my cucumbers and tomatoes? I though of that dead woman with her bags of deer food. Maybe she was trying to fatten them up and keep them out of her garden. Ellie suggested another idea: a gun and a freezer full of venison. It was tempting."
