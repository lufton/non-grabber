description "...when you have Poppy? For my husband's birthday meal at my parents' house, my mom got several tiny superhero action figures for him and set them around his plate. The meal didn't start right away so of course my 3 year old nephew couldn't leave them alone. I told him he couldn't play with them til after but I sat with him and told him about them. After a while, he pointed to The Hulk and stated, "This one has arms like Poppy (my dad/his grandpa)." It was the cutest thing! Poppy is definitely his hero :)"
