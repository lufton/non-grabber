description "There was a large study done on men over 50. One national newscast played it up as very sinificant, another gave it a whiff. Evidently, males over 50 who take a multi-vitamin (doesn't matter the brand), daily, have an 8% less chance of developing any form of cancer than men who don't. It convinced me. This puzzle isn't good, but hopefully, someone will benefit from it."
