description "There was no shower in the tiny little bathroom with barely enough room to turn around in. I never saw the shower room where they took the residents because they were supposed to order a plastic sleeve to protect the big bulky brace I had on my arm, but it never materialized. The brace I had on my arm was one of those blue canvas looking contraptions with Velcro closures and a hinge at the elbow. Although my roommate was wheeled daily to her shower, I had to fend for myself, using my left had to try to give myself a sponge bath in the tiny space while trying not to bang my arm on the walls."
