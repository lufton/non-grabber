description "This is my current favorite shirt. It's actually a gray and burgundy striped turtleneck, but I didn't want to ask people to solve stripes, so I drew it with solid colors. Years ago, my friends Diana, Carol, and I used to co-lead a Girl Scout troop for our kids. Puzzle #38171 shows Carol leading the troop in a t-shirt-painting project. I wore this shirt that day because I loved this shirt then, too, because I feel like the inside of my mind is made of gray and burgundy stripes. That day, I lifted up one of the kids' freshly painted shirts and got a splotch of pink paint on my shirt. Years later, the pink paint is still there. Carol passed away in January, so I wear this shirt in memory of her. The shirt is tattered now, at the edge of wearability. But I'm not ready to let go of it yet."
