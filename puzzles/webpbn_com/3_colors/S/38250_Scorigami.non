description "http://scorigami.com is a site by Jon Bois. It tracks which football scores have happened before in the NFL. This graphic is for all possibilities with neither team scoring over 14, with the upper left being 0-0 and the x-axis being the winning team. . It would get (more) tedious to see even up to 20. The graph on scorigami.com is annotated better than this. The last Super Bowl, at 25-22, seemed like a good Scorigami candidate but wasn't. It reminded me of this, though. I hope some non-football fans find the concept interesting."
