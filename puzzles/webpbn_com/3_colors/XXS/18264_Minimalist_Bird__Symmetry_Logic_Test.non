description "Its a flamingo / I noticed that some puzzles labeled as some guessing required, but can be solved logically if it is assumed to be symmetrical. So i wondered if you could every logically assume a puzzle was symmetrical, this is an example of why you cant; however I was unable to make one with only one color that had only one solution. Can it be logically assumed a B/W puzzle with only one solution and has symmetrical clues must produce a symmetrical image?"
