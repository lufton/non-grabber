description "Happy Halloween! Maybe a waste of time to solve, but I just wanted to wish all my friends from Webpbn a terrific day and a spooky night! :) Just made an abbreviation, as most solvers wouldn't want to solve through the whole thing, after knowing what it's going to be in the first 30 seconds."
