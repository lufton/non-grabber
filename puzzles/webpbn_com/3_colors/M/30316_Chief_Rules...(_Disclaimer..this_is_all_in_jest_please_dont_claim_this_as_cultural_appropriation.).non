description "On our way to Tim Horton's today,there was a protest demonstration blocking traffic at the Tribal Re-leaf pain clinic and dispensary. Apparently the RCMP were raiding it. Charges were laid and marijuana was seized. Later when we got gas at the tribal Shell Gas Bar,I gave the native attendant his dark roast double,double that I bought him and asked him to fill it up. I asked him what happened at the dispensary and he told me the RCMP had to let everyone go and give them back their weed. I asked why and he said" The Chief Rules". I had to laugh. He said" Never take a natives weed away". I think I saw some discarded tomahawks and a few scalps on the side of the road. lol."
