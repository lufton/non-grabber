description "When I put Destyny to bed at night,I read her a story then sing three songs to her. One night she asked me to make up a song for her. From that night on I wracked my brain trying to make up lyrics sung to the tune of "Go to sleep little baby". I changed the word baby for her name Destyny. I finally came up with lyrics that told a story about Daddy taking her and Chastydy to a park to play,then going out for lunch and an ice cream,then going home to watch T.V. and then go to sleep. Destyny loved this story very much to the point that she asked me if it could come true. I told her that after Paytyn was born I promise I will make it come true. Yesterday I kept my promise. We took the kids to a nice playground,then we drove to Woodstock to take them to McDonalds and then to Dairy Queen for an ice cream. After that we went to Nackawic where the worlds largest axe is stationed at a beautiful park with a small beach and fabulous scenery of the river and mountains. That's what this image is of. The blue is the river in the background with a duck swimming. The girls loved the ducks and the axe. So did the boys. It was a wonderful day well spent."
