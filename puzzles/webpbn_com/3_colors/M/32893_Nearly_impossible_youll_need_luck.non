description "Of course, this is a trivial paint-by-number, but the idea occurred to me it might be a nice joke for my first try. It's a 7-10 split in bowling, one of the very toughest to pick up. Maybe something like the 4-6-7-10 would be tougher, but I also wanted to make it easy for people to invert the whole board and fill in the blanks. If it were white with black pins/dots, I think you could swap any two kitty-corner 2x2 regions and get a possible alternate solution. Apologies if anyone did this before! I googled "site:webpbn.com bowling" and nothing turned up. ETA: here's an example video which shows how and why it is so tricky, since I should have realized it wasn't universal knowledge."
