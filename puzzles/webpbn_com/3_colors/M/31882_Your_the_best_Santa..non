description "Well gang,another Christmas approaches. This one is a bit different for me. My wife Niki is taking my girls to Ontario to spend Christmas with her family. That kind of sucks,but I figured I would make the most out of a difficult situation. My main thoughts were "How can I make this as positive as possible for my girls?" Well a good friend and fellow Christian gave me a good suggestion. Her name is Nancy Reid and she has been a source of spiritual guidance for me. She suggested that I explain to my girls that Santa and Rudolph are aware that there are many families in this sort of situation and that they scour the world every night in December looking for houses where children have put a candle or oil lamp oe any sort of light in a window for Santa to see. Santa then knows to visit those homes before Christmas Eve and leave their gifts under the tree early so that they can enjoy the thrill of Christmas with the parent that won't be with them on Christmas Eve. And that is exactly what the girls and I did. We put the candles in the window,and we put milk and cookies on the kitchen table for Santa and Rudolph and the other reindeer. When we woke up the next morning the girls came down stairs at my house and what do you think they discovered? Santa did not disappoint them or me. There were gifts under the tree and the milk and cookies had been consumed and the smiles on my little ones faces brought tears of joy to my eyes. We had perhaps the best Christmas that I can remember. The girls said that everything they got they had asked for and then some. This image is of Paytyn holding the mechanical puppy that Santa brought her. I had to put the green spots on it to make it solvable. I hope it is still a fun solve gang. Thank you all again for all your nice and comical and fun comments on my last puzzle. I still cannot comment on my or anyone else's puzzles but I will solve that problem someday. It just is not a priority right now. Have a very Merry Christmas gang and thanks for all your support."
