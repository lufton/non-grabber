description "When I was 10 we moved to a house where I got to sleep in the downstairs bedroom while the rest of the family slept upstairs. Dad noticed I was a bit unsettled so he said he would paint me a picture of whatever I wanted. I asked for a pirate ship. He did the ocean and sky a midnight blue as if a storm where brewing and one could barely tell where the ocean stopped and the sky began. He loaded a ketchup bottle with black paint and within minutes created this amazing skeleton ship being tossed about in the roiling seas. The painting hung in my room till I went away to college. My parents divorced, the house was sold, and I never saw my painting again. No one knows what happened to it."
