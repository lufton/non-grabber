description "My best friend and I were talking on the phone during our evening walks when out of nowhere, someone starts yelling at him and next thing I know, we're disconnected.. He calls me back a few minutes later and says he had just been jumped by 2 guys. He then sent me a photo slideshow of the damage... face all bloody and ribs badly bruised.. YIKES!"
