description "After I got out of the nursing home, I needed to get the staples removed from my arm. A visiting nurse told me she had made an appointment with my doctor to remove them, but when I got there the doctor knew nothing about it and would not remove the staples. The quack...er orthopedic surgeon who did the surgery was way, way over on the other side of Phoenix. I laid on a gurney for over 24 hours before the hospital could get a surgeon that would come. Many doctors refused to work with this hospital. I finally got an appointment with an ortopedic doctor closer to where I live. The first question he asked me was, "How come, if you had two broken bones, the doctor only fixed one?" While I was reeling from that tidbit, he told me the metal in my arm was going to cause me problems. Seems it sticks out a bit beyond the end of my elbow, which I hadn't noticed because the incision was on the underside of my arm. I now get my own fireworks display if I accidentally bump my elbow."
