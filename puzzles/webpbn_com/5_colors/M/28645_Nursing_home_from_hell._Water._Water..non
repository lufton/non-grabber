description "The building had a very inefficient a/c and we were subjected to two temperatures. Too hot and too cold. In the middle of the afternoon you sweltered and in the middle of the night you froze. One afternoon the ice in my little pitcher had melted and the water was warm and unappealing. I pushed the call button and when a harpie appeared I asked as politely as I could for a fresh pitcher of water. She humphed, grabbed my pitcher, went into the bathroom, dumped the water and refilled the pitcher from the water faucet. She slammed the pitcher down on my table in a way that water sloshed out of the spout and stormed out of the room. The water was very warm because it was hot outside and the water pipes were well heated. One of the office ladies came by with some information and she was kind enough to get me a proper pitcher of water with ice."
