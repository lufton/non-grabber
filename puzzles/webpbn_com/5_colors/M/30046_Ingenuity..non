description "Swimming pool,vinyl liner repair kit. After trying waterproof tape patches with little success,my son A-J decided that a sprig of long grass would do the trick. He stuck the stem thru the tiny hole in the liner and pulled it from the inside until the fat part of the grass plugged the hole. It gives new meaning to "Why pay money when there are things around the house that will do the job". I have another challenge for all you creators out there. Make a puzzle about an idea you had to fix something with whatever you had handy at the time. Or if you've never had to do this make one of something that you think might work to fix anything. It can be no bigger than 40x40 and you can use any and all colours available. :)"
