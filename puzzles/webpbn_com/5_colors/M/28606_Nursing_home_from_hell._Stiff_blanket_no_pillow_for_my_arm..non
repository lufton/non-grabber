description "The second night one of their staff harpies came to change the linen. She took a fairly decent thermal blanket and replaced it with a blanket that was as stiff as cardboard (The green line in the puzzle). She also took the extra pillow that the doctor had ordered for me to prop my arm on. I never did get it back. Had to wad up my top sheet."
