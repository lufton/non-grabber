description "The first two days I got my meds, not always at the right time, but I did get them. For some reason, on the 3rd day, which no one could explain, I was not given my pain medications which I was supposed to get at 6, 2, and 8. I would ring the call button and be told they would be right back. Nada. The bed was so uncomfortable it was unbearable without pain medication. On my bed you could not raise the knee section and the head section at the same time. I gave up, folded up my blanket and sat on the floor. The night nurse, who was pretty nice, was making her rounds and didn't see me at first because I was behind a chair. I explained why I was there and she rushed out and came back shortly with my pain medication."
