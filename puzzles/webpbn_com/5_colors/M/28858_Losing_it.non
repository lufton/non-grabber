description "While doing the dishes I felt a sprinkle of water on the back of my legs. I turned to look but only saw a couple of the cats waiting expectantly to be fed. I turned back to the dishes and felt the sprinkle of water again. Turned and looked again. Same thing. I began to wonder if I was losing it or if this had something to do with the nerve damage they talk about when you get diabetes. Then I caught the guilty culprit. Our youngest cat was trying to catch a fly that was swimming around in their water dish and, of course, every time he got his paw wet he had to shake the water off."
