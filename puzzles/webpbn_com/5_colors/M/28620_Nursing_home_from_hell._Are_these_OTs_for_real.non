description "I think the Occupational Therapists got their certificates on line for $1.98. They decided it was time for me to walk around a bit. I had no sling for my brace so the female OT left and came back with a child sized sling. She was very determined and kept trying to stuff my arm into the undersized sling. I told her several times that it wouldn't fit but she kept trying. I finally had to yell at her. "Stop! It doesn't fit and you are hurting my arm!""
