description "I was taking our ducklings for a walk near the pond. It was time for them to get used to the other animals. We walked along the water drainage ditch and the smallest little bird ran out from the tall grass and hid under the white duck. Baby Q was probably 1 1/2" from tip of beak to end of tail. She looked like a little bumblebee on long legs. Baby Q was an orphaned Bobwhite Quail."
