description "So my cousin had a husband named Dave that loved all things cactus. Their last name starts w/ F and ends in er, so they'd introduce themselves as the F'ers. Well when Dave passed away, my cousin gave his loved ones cactuses to remember him by, I got a patty one like what's shown here in the red pot and I named it Dave. I have it next to some aloe vera as shown here in the blue pot."
