description "Lode Runner wasn't one of the first games I played on my family's old Apple IIe, but it was the first one I played a lot. I remember solving Championship Lode Runner in high school and mailing Broderbund to get a certificate saying I'd solved CLR. I was proud of it! Years later I was shocked to find Doug Smith wrote Lode Runner at University of Washington, and he wasn't even a computer science major! Doug Smith passed in 2014, but Lode Runner inspired many creative spinoffs on many different gaming systems. A lot of the logic to get the tougher gold chests feels somewhat like completing the tougher WebPBN puzzles. The hands are blue because otherwise you'd get alternate solutions. I'm wondering what 8-bit games other WebPBN community members enjoyed! It seems like there could be a lot of good puzzles made from re-rendering personal favorites."
