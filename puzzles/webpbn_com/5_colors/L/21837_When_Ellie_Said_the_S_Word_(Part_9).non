description "(NOTE: This is fiction) The police chief had told Ellie about that woman's toxicology report, but something got garbled when she relayed the information to me - something with an "X" in it? Maybe it started with "M"? Now they were treating the case as an overdose, probably accidental. The stuff could have made her faint, especially if she was exerting herself. As soon as I hung up the phone, it rang again: my son-in-law called from the emergency room. My daughter had been in an accident. "Not serious," he said, "no need to come." But I rushed over to the hospital. My little girl was hurt! In the waiting room, Fran sat with Theo and a bald man. "Fran! What's the matter?" "I--" and she started on a long explanation with the words "dizzy" and "weak" and she sounded like a record played too slow. Theo's face said, she's not making sense; what can you do? I had to cut her off. "I'm so sorry, I have to find my daughter." Over my shoulder I added, "I hope everything will be okay.""
