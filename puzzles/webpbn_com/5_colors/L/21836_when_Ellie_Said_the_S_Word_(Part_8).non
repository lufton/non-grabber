description "I was covered with sweat and dirt and a black mood when Fran and Theo came out of their house with Muggsy. They didn't turn toward the park, but headed in the other direction, toward me. "Sure is a hot one!" said Theo. They were dressed in Bermuda shorts with crisp pleats, and sandals. I wiped my hands on my jeans and walked over to them. "Can't remember a hotter summer," I said, "Or maybe it's me." "I know what that's like," said Fran. She was a few years younger--hot flashes already? Her face was a little puffy and her ankles were swollen. SHe looked tired. Muggsy demanded attention and I stopped to pet him. "How do you like this heat, boy?" What does a dog think about a dead human? Still scratching his ears I looked up at Theo. "Do you think he remembers--" "I doubt it." He smiled. "I guess we should be on our way. C'mon, Muggs." They walked down the street; I watched until they turned the corner out of sight."
