description "The Nobel committee has never shunned controversy about them peace prizes, and this year (2012) they awarded it to the European Union. To those that didn't get what the heck that was about, remember the above image (the original one, not my silly version). On September 22nd 1984 (before the fall of the Berlin wall), French President FranÃ§ois Mitterrand and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl joined hands at a ceremony in Verdun to symbolize French-German reconciliation, France and Germany then and now being the powerhouses in the EU. What pitiful stuff one might say, but please remember that French and German entities was the epitomy of European conflict from the split of the Carolingian Empire in the year 843 and untill the end of World War Two in the mid 20th century. For centuries, conflict between them was considered almost an inevitability. That these two very different leaders (social democrat versus conservative) of these two exact European countries by the mid 1980's thusly illustrate lasting mutual peace ... that's kinda insane. Whatever. Sorry for the history lesson."
