description "My little momma ended up in a wheelchair, and I rolled her all around NYC. She died 2.15.20, right before Covid hit, a miracle of good timing. We were able to be at home with her to the end, and then see everyone at Shiva before NYC went into lockdown. There's a link in the comments where you can see us."
