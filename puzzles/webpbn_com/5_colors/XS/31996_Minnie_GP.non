description "Now she's off-roading in her jacked-up Jeep, which nomenclature came from "General Purpose" or "Government Purpose" vehicle, along with a popular comic strip character whose only word was "jeep". The rain clouds are certainly thickening, but Minnie is looking forward to a little mud flinging."
