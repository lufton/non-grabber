description "Minnie is a blue-haired old lady who drives sports cars. This is her Hellcat convertible (see the big spoiler?), red scarf trailing in the wind. She's trying to outrun the inevitable bird that likes to target convertibles. She's not too worried about it, because she has 700 horsepower. And those clouds haven't thickened up yet, so she can keep the top down."
