description "Momma was a pro,she followed Neil keeping just the right distance from him. It didn't take long for a late model Chevy Caprice just like the one Neil described,to start following Neil. I kept a good distance from them so as not to arouse suspicion. I broke out the opera glasses and was able to get the plate number.I called a buddy of mine to run the plates and he told me the car was registered as being a write off from an accident and was no longer licensed. This meant that we had to stay with the plan until the person went home. I carefully followed the car to a residential neighbourhood. I wrote down the address and figured I would come back tomorrow,but the guy came back out minutes after and took off again. I took a chance and picked the lock to get a look inside. What I found concerned me. There were pictures of Neil in a darkroom. Why was this guy stalking him? Off to the side next to a phone,I saw a business card from Mendozza's car rental. The name on the business card was Susan Mendozza."
