description "I decided to go back to my office and call Neil to report my findings. As I approached the door,I heard a commotion from inside. I pulled out my pistol and carefully proceeded inside. The noise was coming from my bathroom. As I approached the bathroom I was greeted by a display of plumbers butt. Further investigation revealed it was Neil incognito again,this time as a plumber,and he was working on my pipes.I poured myself a cup of coffee and sat on the bowl to talk to him." Neil why are you working on my sink?,I don't remember having a problem with it."..I wanted to see you so I disguised myself as a plumber. Since I was here,I decided to check for rings or some kind of valuables. I got bored waiting for you.." Well you won't find anything of value in there,or anywhere else in my office. I traced that SUV to a rental,and the guy used a bogus name and I.D.,the fact that he switched vehicles concerns me that he knows you hired me."..I don't think so Mr.Noir,let's try again tonight and see what vehicle follows me.." Ok Neil,but I did see the guy taking pictures of you,and you weren't even doing anything suspicious. I find that strange."..Yeah that is a little weird,what do you think could be up with that?.." I'm not sure,but I have a plan.I'll follow you tonight and report to you tomorrow,but right now I need to get some sleep."..Ok Noir,but unfortunately I cracked your pipe while taking it off,call a plumber and add it to my bill.." This is starting to get expensive Neil,maybe you should try using a disguise that won't involve you in breaking my things.".. I'll see what I can come up with Guy."
