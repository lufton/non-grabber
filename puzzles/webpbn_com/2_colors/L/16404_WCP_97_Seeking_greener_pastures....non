description "With overall decline in polar bear populations due to climate change and resulting habitat loss, polar bears may have to adapt by migrating to other areas and exploiting alternate food sources in order to survive. The decrease in the pack-ice cuts them off from their primary food sources: seals and fish and forces them to look landward for new foods. This may cause conflict as their growing proximity to humans increases the likelihood of violent and/or fatal interactions between the 2 species. Catch 22: "Adapt or die" easily becomes "die adapting"."
