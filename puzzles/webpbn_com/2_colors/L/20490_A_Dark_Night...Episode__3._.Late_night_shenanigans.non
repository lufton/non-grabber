description "I went back to Carl's to thank momma for helping me. Carl said momma went to an all night bingorama and roller skating marathon being held at the old Palace Arena. I hadn't played bingo in a long time so I drove over to the Palace to play a little bingo with momma. When I got inside momma was doing laps around the rink. She convinced me to don the skates and dance with her. "I thought you would be playing bingo momma"..Ahh,bingo is for old ladies,I want to skate.C-mon young fella let's dance."..Momma dragged me on the floor and started performing dance steps and moves I've only seen on televised Olympic ice skating events. She picked me up and spun me around like I was a rag doll..Wow momma your some skater.."Naw,not really Mr.Noir,but thanks."..Well momma I wanted to thank you for helping me tonight.."No thank you,it was fun.You do realize,that was a woman driving that car don't you Guy?"..A woman,what makes you say that momma?.."Guy,no man that drives an old Chevy Caprice would wear gloves. She's wearing a disguise to throw you off."..Hey that makes sense,so it's an infatuated woman stalking him.." I don't know if she's fat or not Guy,I just know she's female."..I better go warn Neil,to be careful and tell him it's a woman were dealing with. Could you let me down momma,I'm starting to feel a little sick.." Sure Guy,just a couple more spins ok."..Whatever you say momma."
