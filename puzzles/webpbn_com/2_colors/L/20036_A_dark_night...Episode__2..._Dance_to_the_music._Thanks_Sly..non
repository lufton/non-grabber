description "Once inside,I made my way to the dance floor just as " The Power Of Love" by Frankie Goes To Hollywood finished playing. The two guys dancing broke free from their embrace,gave each other a kiss,and started walking towards me hand in hand. The tall guy was sporting a flamin wild doo that would challenge Lady Gaga in a bizarre contest. The other guy's receding hairline made his head look like it was carved from a block of wood with a melon baller. They were both wearing leather jackets with silver studs adorning them. The smell of leather in the place was intense. I asked them if they knew a Francis Barabichi,and before i could hear their answer,i felt an arm with a death grip envelope me. I felt myself being lifted off the ground. The arm was big and black and it bent my Camel out of shape. Just before the lights went totally out,I heard a voice say "Let him go Vincent,I'll talk to him when he wakes up""
