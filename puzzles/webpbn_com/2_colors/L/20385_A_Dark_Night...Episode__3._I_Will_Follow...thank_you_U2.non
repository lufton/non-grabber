description "I parked around the corner of Neil's house and waited for him to leave for work.I waited till he got 2 blocks away,then I started following him. I didn't notice anyone following him as he drove to his precinct,but after he got in his uniform,and drove away in his police cruiser,I watched an SUV pull out of a parking spot and start to follow him. It was one of those Korean models that have all the goodies,and a reasonable sticker price. I didn't know whether to follow or not,because Neil said it was a late model 2 door hardtop that was following him. I waited a bit,then decided to follow. The SUV went everywhere Neil went,but I didn't notice any other vehicle following him. The guy driving the SUV wore a fedora and sunglasses. I noticed him snapping pictures of Neil with what looked to be an expensive camera. I wrote down the plate number and followed Neil till the end of his shift,without incident. I called it a night,and would report my findings to Neil the next day. I let out a belch and tasted chicken gumbo. It almost tasted as good the second time around. I think I'll stop at Carl's for breakfast."
