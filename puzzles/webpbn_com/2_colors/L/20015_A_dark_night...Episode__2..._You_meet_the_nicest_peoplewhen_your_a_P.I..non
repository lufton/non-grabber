description "Gusepi said he was sending cheques to his son Francis to a Donsbar College. He said Donsbar stood for Doctors,Obstetricians,Nurses,Surgeons,Barristers,Attorneys,and Realtors. I had never heard of a College that specialized in this mix of professions,and i scratched my head trying to understand how the Realtors fit in. I immediately became suspicious. When i got to the Registry of Colleges office,I was greeted at the front desk by a middle aged woman who wore her hair in the most severe bun i have ever seen. It made her forehead look like a billboard. Her ample bosom was dwarfed by her snozhola. She was a lovely thing." I'm looking to see if a Francis Barabichi was registered at Donsbar College.".. There is no Donsbar College. Are you a detective?..."What gave me away"... I have a nose for you guys..."You certainly do,and a couple of other things too"...Excuse me..."Never mind"...I bet your carrying a big gun, right?..."Well my ex girlfriend thought so"...Excuse me..."Oh nothing,by the way,you don't have a daughter that goes by the name of Cans Lerou do you?".. She's my sister,how did you know?.. "There's a slight resemblance between you two. Well thanks for your help."..Listen i get off at 5,would you like to buy a girl a cup of coffee?..Seeing how i no longer had a girlfriend,i momentarily considered her proposition." Sorry,i'd love to,but looking at your lovely face,just reminded me,I have to go get my tailpipe replaced. It fell off as i was entering your parking lot."...Excuse me."
