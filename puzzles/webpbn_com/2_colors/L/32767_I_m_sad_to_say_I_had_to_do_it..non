description "Our 58 Dodge has not been driven for years now.I had it at a friends garage and he was going to fix it for me. He has it running but because he runs a towing business as well as the garage he has not been able to work on the car as fast as he would like. The car is rotting away as it sits so I decided to sell her. Let's face it folks, it is just a material thing and sometimes we have to make hard decisions. Now that I have custody of my girls I do not have the financial means to keep the car in good shape. At least this way the car will get refurbished and we will be able to see it and drive in it again even though we no longer own it."
