description "Seeing how I was going to have to follow Neil on his night shift,i needed to get some rest,but first I needed some nourishment. I know it's foolish,but I figured I'd go to Carl's. " Hey Guy,haven't seen you in awhile"..No and I'm not sure why I'm here now,but I'm hoping you have something Carl that won't put me in the hospital.."Aw c-mon Guy,your gonna give my place a bad name."..You did that,when you decided to name this restaurant "Carl's Place".." Now that's just mean and uncalled for Guy,I have a mind to not even serve you anything."..That would be the kindest thing you ever did for me Carl,anyhow I'm sorry,but can you bring me anything edible. I have a hard night ahead of me.." As a matter of fact I can. How about a nice big bowl of chicken gumbo?"..Aw Carl that sounds so good,but does it actually have fresh chicken in it?.." Yup,and potatoes,carrots,green beans,parsnips,and a host of other good veggies."..No bugs,or bits of cloth,or fingernail clippings,or fingers for that matter?.."Nope,just good ingredients Guy.".. Your not gonna come back and tell me you just served your last bowl,or anything like that are you Carl?.." No I have lots Guy,just try some.".. Ok Carl sounds good,bring me a nice big bowl,and some bread and butter too please.." Coming right up Guy."..To my surprise,Carl brought me a bowl of the best chicken gumbo that I have ever tasted,and he had rye bread too. I told him how great it was,and he said thanks and then shouted to the kitchen area.."Hey Ma,Guy loves your chicken gumbo..My mom is visiting for a couple of weeks,so you might want to come here a lot,before she leaves."..That explains a lot Carl. See you tomorrow morning,oh and tell your mom,I love her."
