description "After the police came to take Susan away,momma invited Neil and I to come back to Carl's for some chicken gumbo." Eat up boys,it's been a busy night,you must be hungry."..Momma,how can you be so calm,after what we've been thru tonight?said Neil.." Heck that was nothing,there was more violence at the Palace Arena.First a bruhaha broke out at the bingo game because some woman spilled her mint tea and ruined another woman's cards and dopper.Then a fight started on the rink when a teenage couple crashed into a nice woman who was performing a dance routine."..Momma,were you the woman involved in both cases?..Me,c-mon Guy,do I look like the violent type?"..No momma,you certainly don't. Anyway,thank you for all your help momma..Do I pay the remainder of your fee to you Guy or momma?..Pay it to Guy,Neil, I'm just happy for the excitement. I didn't want to spend another night playing go fish with Carl. I love that boy,but he is so boring."..Gee momma,that's an awfully short skirt your wearing,I'm sorry for staring,but you have great gams for a woman your age.." Don't be sorry Neil,and thank you. Yes I'm wearing this skirt to torture my husband. I'm going home tonight,and he'll be anxious to see me,but I like to see him squirm a bit before I give him what he wants."..Your amazing momma,and you make the best chicken gumbo too.." Thanks Guy,now eat up boys,your gumbo is getting cold.""
