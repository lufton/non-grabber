description "Weighing in at 35kg (75lb)and about a metre(3ft)long the wombat is a decidedly cute Aussie critter. To use technical terminology they are built like a brick outhouse. Nocturnal and lumbering, they dig burrows which is annoying to farmers. I fell victim to one of their burrows by stepping in it while running by torchlight. Tore a tendon or two and said some bad words."
