description "This is a very lame face drawing. It's also what I look like when something is lame so it's "my lame face", it's a pun. Also, The "bandage" right above the eyes shows he is injured or lame, Thanks to John Micdonald for pointing that out. Sorry if you expected something great, I warned you in the title."
