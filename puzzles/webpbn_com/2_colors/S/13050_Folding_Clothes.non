description "I taught my young son how to fold his shirts: fold in half, and if you want, fold in half again. He would fold it in 1/2, then take each side and fold again, turn over and fold, then turn it over again, making slight adjustments at every turn and fold. A total mess but I never said a word. When he was 20, I asked him why he did that. He said That's how you taught me to fold paper airplanes. AND he really was folding his clothes into "paper airplanes". So I guess I can fold a paper airplane and raise a creative child, but not draw a puzzle of a paper airplane. Maybe if I drew a shirt, it would look like a paper airplane."
