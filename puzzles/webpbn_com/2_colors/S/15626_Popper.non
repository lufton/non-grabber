description "As in mr. Popper's penquins. I am having trouble making the feet look right. If anyone would like, they could make this again with better looking feet. This could be much improved but I'm not a very good artist. He's wearing a hat and holding a cane, if you couldn't tell. It's easier to see if you don't use dots, just black and white."
