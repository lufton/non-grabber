description "This is how we get our milk now,in plastic bags that you put in a container. I just recently heard that a lot of people from the United States think that we Canadians are weird because we get our milk in bags. I don't know if they realize you put the bag in a plastic container,and cut the very tip of one corner off,and then pour. What's so weird about that?"
