description "Hi gang,Destyny here. My dad is real proud of me,because I finally started to walk. I tried a couple of months ago,but i kept falling down,so i decided not to bother. I'm wearing my brother JD's hat backwards here cause my dad thinks it's real cute. He's such a sap. I better go now,I see my dad's eyes tearing up. I'll go give him a kiss and a hug,that will put him over the edge. Buy for now."
