description "Call me a thief,I stole sensei's puzzle and expanded on it. I wanted to title this puzzle "Innocence" because it's meant to portray two innocent children swinging on a tire swing,oblivious that what a lot of people today would think is wrong or naughty. I wasn't going to publish it at all because some people will perceive it the wrong way,and because people will label me as a thief,but i thought the image was so cool,as was Tom's puzzle,and the solve looks to be a decent challenge so i decided to publish it. I know my buddy Tom will take it as a compliment,that i liked his puzzle so much that i would expand on his idea.:)"
