description "He only exists in my imagination. You can tell by looking at his face that he is kind, compassionate, and good-natured. He has integrity, wisdom, and sensuality. He is old enough to know better but still young enough to enjoy the pleasures of life. He doesn't need alcohol to celebrate, and is loyal to his commitments. And of course he is committed to making me a happy woman. :-)"
