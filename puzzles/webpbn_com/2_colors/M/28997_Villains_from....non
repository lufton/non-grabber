description "my imagination. After watching so many villains on so many super hero shows that have just as many powers as the heroes,I've decided to try and create some of my own with new amazing powers. Let's start with Cement Head. He came about when a sidewalk of freshly laid concrete was trampled on by a gang of teenage thugs. He came to life and decided to seek revenge,terrorizing mal- behaving teenagers at night. He spews balls of aggregate at them causing them much pain and bodily harm. He is a shape shifter and can transform himself into any kind of ornamental character. If you should wake up someday and look out the window while drinking your first cup and you happen to notice a cement statue of cupid with water escaping from his mouth that you never had before,lock up your teens."
