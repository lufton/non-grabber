description "Hi everybody,Destyny here again. My daddy decided i didn't have to move out of the house because i like to wear my hat backwards. He said it's ok as long as i let him cut a hole in it at the top,so that my mohawk could stick out of it. I said sure thing pops. He and mommy are trying to get me to sit on my potty,to do my business. Mommy took a picture of me sitting on it,and she posted it on facebook. It's gonna be real embarrassing when i grow up,and i see all these pictures of me. Oh well i'll just have to learn to enjoy laughing at myself,just like my daddy. See you all later"
