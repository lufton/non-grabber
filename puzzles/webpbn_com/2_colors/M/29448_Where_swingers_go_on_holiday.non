description "My next holiday will be spent swinging a metal detector searching for gold in the Australian outback. Carrying a small pick to dig for any targets, with a hat to keep the sun off, a fly net to keep the gazillion flies away from my face. Backpack with water, energy bars, GPS, UHF radio, spare batteries. Detecting around century-old workings can yield a nugget or two. The shafts were dug by hand through the rock and go straight down for many metres. Everyone knows not to go too close to the shaft entrance. The ladders have rotted years ago and, with one slip, the adventure would soon turn to disaster."
