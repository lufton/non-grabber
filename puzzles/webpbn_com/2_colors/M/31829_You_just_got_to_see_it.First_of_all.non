description "First of all,the only way I can comment on my last puzzle is to make a new one and comment on it. So thank you everyone for your nice comments on my last puzzle. It is nice making puzzles again and I will try to make them as much as I can,but life now for me is amazing and very busy. Yes John Chastydy is 5,that is something else. Seems like just yesterday that she was born. Niki and her boyfriend brought my 3 girls to Harvest House for our free Monday night supper that we put on for anyone in the community that wants a free meal and comradery. Our Harvest House band played some music for everyone before supper. This puzzle represents me playing my washtub bass. In real life,Chastydy was sitting on a stool next to me,and she was shaking a musical egg. She was having fun and she loves joining in with our band and playing music with her old dad. She's quite good(big surprise considering who her dad is).If any of you are interested in seeing our bands play a bit. You can go on line and look up Harvest House Woodstock. Go on their homepage and click on video's and you can find our band playing a service there. We're not too polished yet,but we sure have fun. I'm the bald guy with a goatee sitting playing the galvanized washtub. Talk to you all later."
