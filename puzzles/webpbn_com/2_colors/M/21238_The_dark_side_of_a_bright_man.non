description "Many grew up learning about Sherlock Holmes from the Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce movies produced in the late thirties to mid forties. Based soley on those movies, you would not have known about the great detective's cocain addiction. Even in the popular BBC radio series staring Carleton Hobbs and Norman Shelley, references to Holmes' current or former habit were toned down or edited out altogether when aired in the U.S. during the early sixties. Holmes defended his use of cocain as the only way to keep his remarkable brain stimulated when between cases (too bad Web PBN wasn't around then). With Watson's insistence and help, Holmes was able to wean himself from that "drug mania" sometime around 1894, just prior to The Adventure of the Missing Three-quarter. For some time Watson was clearly worried that his friend would relapse but, as far as we know or will ever know, he never did. ================================================================================ When our son was eight years old I went to tuck him in one night and found him crying. That day in school they taught about the effects of cigarette smoking. I was a smoker and now Alex knew what harm I was doing to his dad. - - - - - I had my last cigarette that night, in 2002. I guess sometimes, maybe often, we lose sight of our importance and responsibility to others until we see it from their eyes."
