description "The par 2 7th hole at Beardhairs,proves to be too much for this golfer who while hanging upside down and attached to the bungee cord, he wanted to be the first player ever to birdie the hole,and he tried to place the ball directly into the cup. Once the alligator at right got hold of the back of his cap,it was game over. The rescue helicopter hovers in vain,knowing that all that will remain to rescue is the lower torso. The good news is they can sell his golf shoes in the Pro Shop."
