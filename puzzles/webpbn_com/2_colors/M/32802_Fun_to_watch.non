description "Watching some of our great Canadian tennis players compete at the U.S Open tennis championship is fun to watch. Sorry gang but I am experiencing the same problem that I had in the past with not being able to comment on my puzzles or others puzzles. Valerie is trying to help me with this once again. But please know that I truly appreciate your comments on my puzzles and that I enjoy peeking at your puzzles. Thank you all. Love Aldege."
