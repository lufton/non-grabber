description "As I sat waiting for my sandwich,i kept looking out the window for any suspicious behaviour. I felt nervous,tense,as if something was about to erupt. I guess too many bumps on the squash will do that to you. Suddenly the nice old couple got up and headed right for me. Just as they arrived,Carl laid a plate before me..."What the &#(!*$ is this Carl?..I call it my origami delight Guy...What country is it suppose to be?..Guy are you blind? It's shaped like a bird...Hey your right,i think i see some feathers on it...That's fluff from my dish cloth,it got in the way when I was using the clever,sorry Guy... Forget the fluff Carl,i don't remember ordering a bird sandwich,why did you cut it up like this?... I had to trim the mold off the bread,and i just got artistic like...Mold,your giving me moldy bread?..Well you seemed so excited that i had rye bread,i didn't want to disappoint you Guy...Take it back Carl,I think i'm going to be sick...Ok Guy,but i don't have anything else right now... No problem,i'll just drink my coffee... CARL,I HAVE FLOATIES IN MY COFFEE."
