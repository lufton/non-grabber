description "I'm Destyny,don't mind me,i'm just chillin and playing with my toes that i recently discovered. My dad,who is AldÃ¨ge,and also known as Mort by some of his friends says i have cute little toes,and i'm starting to believe him. Anyway he asked me to come here to let you all know that my mom Niki posted another video on her facebook profile. This one is about our family going for one last drive in our old Dodge before my dad puts it away for the winter,and we visited that shoe tree out in the country that my dad made a puzzle of a long time ago,so please check it out and i hope you enjoy it. See you later.:)"
