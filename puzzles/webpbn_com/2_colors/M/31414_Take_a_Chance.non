description "The title isn't really related to the puzzle. But they're both related to my situation. I ran into Miles Luna, a writer and actor, mainly known for RWBY and Camp Camp. I chickened out and didn't take a chance to say hello to him. I adore the man to bits and pieces and legitimately want to get to know him. So the loving swans was a nice image."
