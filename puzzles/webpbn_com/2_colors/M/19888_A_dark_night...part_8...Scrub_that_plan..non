description "What did you use on me to knock me out,chloroform?...That's Carl's and my secret. Mobster,ha what a joke. The mob would never recruit a schmuck like you. I should of known when Cans told me your name was Lance Schvinklehammer. The mob wouldn't suffer the embarrassment Of recruiting a guy named Lance. So what kind of weapon is that?... It's a toilet brush... What were you gonna do,scrub me to death?...My plan was to scare you into dropping the investigation on me... Why Lance,what are you hiding?...I don't want Candace to know what i do for a living...What is your occupation?... I'm a Fuller Brush salesman...Snicker,snicker,well i'm glad you came clean with me Lance,but why does Candice's father suspect your a mob guy?...They're one of my biggest customers,i'm at the Godfathers place once a week...Your kidding me right,what does the mob order so much of?... Well a lot of bleach for one thing,and dark plastic bags,and loads of nail brushes...Nail brushes huh,go figure. So why don't you want Candace to know your real job,is it cause you don't make enough money to keep her in the style she's accustomed to. I mean it shouldn't take too much cash,it's not like she's a classy babe,she wears Fruit of the Loom undies...Bonk,slap,kapow...ugh,thump."
