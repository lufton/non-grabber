description "I went down the basement expecting to see another flood. I couldn't find anything wrong.I figured I would prime the pump again and see what happens. Yes,water restored again. But a couple of hours later,same thing. Pump running and no water. I could always get the water running again by priming the pump. Some how water or air must be leaking somewhere. I went to check the hole where the well head is. Sure enough I could hear air escaping. I jumped into the hole and cut back some of the weeping tile that the well hose runs through. I saw a small trickle of water coming from the pipe. I moved the pipe slightly to investigate. Then suddenly I was at a water park with sprinklers and a wave pool. My well was emptying into the dug pit. I bolted out of the hole like I was Private Benjamin and raced down the basement to turn my pump off."
