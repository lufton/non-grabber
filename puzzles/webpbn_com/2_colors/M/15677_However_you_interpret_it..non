description "This could be a variety of things,it could be a flattened Brian,but i doubt he has a big belly like this and that's for Marz to make,or it could be a flattened Aldege big belly and all,still holding the fridge roller that gave way while he was moving the fridge as Annalivia said,or it could just be Aldege exercising with a dumb bell to try to lose some of that big gut(A not likely scenario as you can't get him off the computer to exercise)Let us know if you have different ideas as what it is.lol."
