description "Sorry for the downer folks, but I thought that some of you might want an update as to the story of our family. Let,s not focus however on the tragic end, but on the bright future ahead. Many of you know about the breaking up of our family and then my girls being returned to me. Well my wife has fallen further to the evil of drug use and left her 17 year old son alone at what was the family home. I took him into our home to be with his sisters. Consequently the family home was then abandoned and was ransaked and set on fire. This puzzle illustrates what is left standing.The good news is that now I can focus on the welfare of these wonderful children and they now have a new start with no fighting parents and no drug use in their home. The future looks bright for these little ones and we pray for salvation and mercy for their mother. If many of you feel that this puzzle is inappropriate, please say so and I will remove it. I love my WEBPBN family and I wish you all the best."
