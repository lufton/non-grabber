description "Boston Doves (1907 â 1910). Yes, I realize some of these old logos are simple, but I think they are cool. This team is now know as the Atlanta Braves. What I am trying to do is show "most" all of the old logos for the MLB teams back to 1900, some have a lot some only a few, please enjoy!"
