description "I returned to my office much later that evening,feeling secure that i had convinced Lance to tell Cans and her father the truth about his occupation,but just divulge that his government contract was his big money making account and not to even mention his mob contacts. I could smell her as soon as i entered the building,and the scent got stronger,and stronger all the way to my office. It's that sweet honey nectar,flowers in bloom,someone just cut the grass,holy crap it's springtime freshness smell. There on my desk was a note with a cheque for the remaining amount of my fee,plus a bonus. The letter said," Dear Mr. Noir,here is the rest of what i owe you with a little extra to pay for a new hat,and bandages for your lumps. Lance has told me everything,and father was thrilled when he found out how much money he earns. Lance asked me to leave you a special little bonus,it's in your closet. Love Cans Lerou."
