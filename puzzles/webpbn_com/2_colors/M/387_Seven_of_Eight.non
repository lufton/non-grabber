description "An octopus. Or a septapus. Or maybe the other arm is behind him or something. Him? How do I know it's a boy octopus anyway? Could be an lady octopus for all I know. I mean, I'm not a marine biologist or sushi chef or anything like that. Well, if it's sushi, then it's probably a girl. Sushi the Octopus. Sounds like a girls name to me. I could be wrong. I could even be wrong about it being an octopus. It could be a spider, don't you think? A spider with a missing leg. Maybe he's hiding it behind him. Of course, it might not be a male spider. It could be a female spider hiding a leg behind her. I'm not an etomologist, after all. Not much of an artist either. Honestly, you should be able to tell a spider from an octopus."
