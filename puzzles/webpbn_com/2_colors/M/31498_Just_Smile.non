description "The song Smile by Landon Austin has been stuck in my head lately. Every time I work with this one specific coworker we have a lot of fun. And it's because we see each other that we smile. And it's because we smile that we have fun. The image isn't really related other than the fact that he's given me similar flowers before. I think they were weeds. But still thoughtful."
