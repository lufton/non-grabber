description "My mother wanted to name me Terri but her friend/neighbor said that's a Terri-ble name and her daughter should have a beautiful name like Alicia instead. No offense to any Terris out there, this is just my story. Alicia is a Swedish name that means Truth, though some will say its a Greek name meaning Noble. Terri means People's Ruler.. I am definitely more of an Alicia and thankful for my mom's friend that gave me this beautiful name."
