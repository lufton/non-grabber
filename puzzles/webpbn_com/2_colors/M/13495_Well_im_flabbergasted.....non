description "Bill,what a display of poor sportsmanship.It's an egg shaped green with a severe uphill then downhill slope,he had a 2 foot putt for a birdie and he pulled it and it's run off the green.He'll have a hard time salvaging a bogie now. Dottie i've never seen anyone snap they're putter over they're knee like that before have you? No Bill and I'm sure the tournament directors will have a decision or ruling to make on this one."
