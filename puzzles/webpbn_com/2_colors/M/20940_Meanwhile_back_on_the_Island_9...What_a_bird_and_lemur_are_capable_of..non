description "First General Kroc commissioned the bird and lemur to stitch together a most royal,regal,and handsomely tailored uniform for our distinguished leader,so that he can impress that lovely mermaid. They put a headpiece together too,made from some of the birds nest. He dabbed a little rum coconut cocktail under his arms and on his neck to aid in his quest to impress. Let's hope he didn't get mixed up and use the monkey dung swill that he feeds the peasants."
