description "It's was about two weeks since I talked to Francis,and i've had no correspondence from him or his father. Gusepi gave me a large advance,so i wasn't concerned about my fee,but I was curious to hear how he took the news about losing his son,but gaining a daughter.Who knows maybe Francis will go the full monty and get married some day and Gusepi will have a son in law. I figured I would take a drive to Don's Bar and see if Igor was still running things. "Mr.Noir,how you doing?"...Not bad Igor,ah I mean Vincent..."I'm real sorry if I hurt you,no hard feelings I hope"..Nah,but my Camel might not feel that way..."Huh"..Forget about it. So is Francis around?.."What you haven't heard?"...Afraid not,what's up?.."I better let Francis tell you Noir,I'm sure you'll be hearing from him soon. What can i get you Noir?"..I'll have a Molson Stock Ale and what do you recommend to eat?.."Ooh the imported stuff. We just put this bagels and lox stuff on the menu,want to try it?"..Sounds good,and can you add a dill pickle?.."No problem Noir,coming right up."..I nursed my beer and watched the crowd. The place wasn't packed,but business had picked up considerably. There were a couple of sweethearts making out in a booth,and a bunch on the dance floor. They got a new disco ball. A bigger one. I noticed everyone was draped in leather. Pants,jackets,leather hats,you know the kind John Lennon use to wear. Igor dropped a plate in front of me. Something was still alive in my bagel. Vincent what the heck is this? Bagel and lox is suppose to be smoked salmon..."Yeah,that's a little rich for the crowd in here Noir. We substitute the salmon with smelts."..Smelts,lake smelts or ocean?..."Uh,their actually from the little swamp behind our property here."..Swamp,never mind,this one is still alive,it's tail is wagging,and is that a fin sticking out the side?.."Yeah,it's dorsal fin won't let the bun sit on properly,so i fold it to the side. You want I should put a slit in the top of the bagel instead?".. No,just take it back,I can't eat that,and what's that green and black stuff on the bagel? That's not mold is it?.."No,we substitute the bagel with an onion bun."..Good Lord,I can't wait to go back to Carl's."
