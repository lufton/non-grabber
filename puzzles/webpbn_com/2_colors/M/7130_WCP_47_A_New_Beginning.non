description "This is a sad one, so fair warning. A negative image of a yahrtzeit, or Jewish remembrance candle. The spelling is inexact as the word is from a language which uses non-arabic letters. It is traditionally burned for 24 hours on the anniversary of the passing of one's parent, from sundown to sundown, unless the anniversary falls on Friday after nightfall or on Saturday. In this case, the candle is lit at sundown on Saturday to avoid burning it on the Sabbath. My mother was the one who was big on tradition in my family. We had several, but they mostly revolved around the standard Thanksgiving and Christmas observances that are common in America. Now that she is gone, we have only one. Though my mother's family was Jewish, she never practiced and she converted to Christianity. However, she burned a yahrtzeit candle for her mother every year on April first. Since her passing in December of 2007 to Pneumonia after minor surgery, my Father and I burn one for my mother now. In addition to being a wife and mother, she was a US Army veteran, a US Postal Worker and a breast cancer survivor. She is survived by her husband, two sons, three brothers and a sister, and we all miss her terribly."
