description "Winklepicker is a style of pointy shoe or boot. Where did that word come from? Winkle is an English word for a water snail cooked and served in the shell as a delicacy, and one would need something to pick the snail out of it's shell. Reminiscent of medieval footwear worn by jesters and today by pop stars, the feature which gives both the boot and shoe their name is the very sharp and quite long pointed toe."
