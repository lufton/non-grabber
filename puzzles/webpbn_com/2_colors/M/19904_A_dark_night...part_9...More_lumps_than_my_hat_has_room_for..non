description "What makes that brush handle so hard?.. It has a plastic covered lead pipe for a handle. Special mob order. It also shoots bullets. Now explain Noir,how do you know what make of underwear my girlfriend wears? C-mon Lance,her pants are so tight you can see the label right through them... Oh...,well i'm sorry for clubbing you then,but you still deserve it for saying Candice has no class. Listen Noir,i'll pay you double your fee,if you just tell her i'm a straight up guy with a regular 9 to 5,and no connections to the mob... No offense Lance,but i don't come cheap,how can you afford that?... Ha,don't make me laugh Noir,i earn a six figure income,i could buy a dozen lousy detectives like you,no offense. I forgot to tell you,the government is my second biggest customer...That's democracy for you,it's nice to know where my tax dollars are going. I'd love to take some of my tax dollars back off you Lance,but just keep it. I think you should just tell Cans and her father the truth. I'm sure when they hear how much income you have,everything will work out just fine. I will let you buy me a new hat though,and buy Cans some underwear from "Fredricks of Hollywood"...Bang,crash,ooof,slap,slap,slap...thud."
