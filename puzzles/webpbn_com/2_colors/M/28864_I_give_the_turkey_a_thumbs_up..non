description "I took the whole family to a nice family home cooking style restaurant for their Thanksgiving Turkey Special. As I mentioned in Teresa's puzzle. I hate the clean up after. I like the preparation cause Niki and I do it together and we consume some wine and a few wobbly pops while doing it. My girls all wore dresses and mommy put their hair in braids,pigtails and ponytails. I don't mind telling you they were as cute as they come. All the patrons thought so too and I was one proud daddy. I watched Destyny and Chastydy eating with smiles on their faces and asked Destyny if the food was good. She said" Yep,I give the turkey a thumbs up" We all had a good laugh. Happy Thanksgiving to all my Canadian friends."
