description "I think it was a good one,but i'm not sure. She shook,and shuddered,her breathing was erratic,she let out a sigh,then suddenly had a big beautiful smile,exposing her dimples. She was having a dream. She nestled back into the crook of my arm. That's when i noticed the tears running down her cheeks. They weren't her tears,they were mine. Destyny has a high fever (102.8 degrees fahrenheit) and is not feeling well. Please get better soon my love,daddy can't bare to see you suffer."
