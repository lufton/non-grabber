description "Francis asked Igor(Vincent)to turn the Wurlitzer down. I was grateful.He had a strong resemblance to his mother. Flamboyant but not in a gaudy way. He looked more female than male,and his voice had a soft melodic character to it. He actually made for a very attractive woman. "So Francis,I guess it's safe to say,your a man that wishes he was a woman". " Are your dad's cheques paying for the operation?"...Well not the operation your thinking of,I haven't gone the full monty yet,but they are paying for this establishment,until it becomes self sufficient..." Is this why you don't want to take over the family business,cause you want to make it on your own?"...No,i would love to run the family business,I have a lot of great ideas for new product lines,but my dad would never understand or accept who I am. My mother always new,and she would let me dress up like a girl,but not in front of my dad..." I understand Francis,but maybe you should give your dad the benefit of the doubt,he might surprise you.".. Yeah and if he doesn't,than i'll lose this business too..." I think you should give yourself more credit too,this place looks like it may take off if you get rid of the disco ball.I'm just kidding about the ball,I know you'll do fine." Maybe your right Mr.Noir,I would love to work with my dad and share my ideas with him..." Go for it Francis,let Igor run the bar for you for awhile. In the meantime,does anyone have a straight Camel they can give me. Oops sorry,maybe that wasn't the best way to say that.""
