description "Meet Toshiro Eisenmann, son of Captain Gerhard Eisenmann (#32830). From July 1870 to February 1871, Captain Gerhard Eisenmann and his ship Kleinhof were blockaded in Nagasaki. During his stay, the captain had an intimate relationship with Himari Yoshimori, a cobbler's daughter. In late February that year, Gerhard left Nagasaki without knowing the Himari was pregnant. Six months later, Toshiro was born. Toshiro always wanted to be a sailor and to meet with his father in Germany. At 16, Toshiro joined the Imperial Japanese Navy and played a minor but vital role in the development of the Japanese Navy. Toshiro was the second in command of the Battleship Fuji during the Battle of Tsushima. He received Order of the Golden Kite for his bravery in the battle. Before the beginning of WW2, he retired with the rank of Colonel. He never regretted to be a general. He bought a small tugboat with his pension, and named it Himari after his mother. You can see Himari in the picture above his right shoulder. He never met his father."
