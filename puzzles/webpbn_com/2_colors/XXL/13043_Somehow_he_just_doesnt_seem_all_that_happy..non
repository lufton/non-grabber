description "Jolly Roger pirate flag. There are many theories as to how the flag obtained its name. A Wikipedia article on the flag says: "The name "Jolly Roger" goes back at least to Charles Johnson's A General History of the Pyrates, published in Britain in 1724.[3] Johnson specifically cites two pirates as having named their flag "Jolly Roger": Bartholomew Roberts in June, 1721[4] and Francis Spriggs in December 1723.[5] While Spriggs and Roberts used the same name for their flags, their flag designs were quite different, suggesting that already "Jolly Roger" was a generic term for black pirate flags rather than a name for any single specific design. Neither Spriggs' nor Roberts' Jolly Roger consisted of a skull and crossbones.[6] Richard Hawkins, captured by pirates in 1724, reported that the pirates had a black flag bearing the figure of a skeleton stabbing a heart with a spear, which they named "Jolly Roger".[7] Despite this tale, it is assumed by most that the name Jolly Roger comes from the French words jolie rouge, meaning "pretty red" and referring to a plain red flag which was flown to indicate that the ship would fight to the death, with no quarter given or expected.[8] During the Elizabethan era "Roger" was a slang term for beggars and vagrants who "pretended scholarship."[9] "Sea Beggars" had been a popular name for Dutch privateers since the 16th century. Another theory states that "Jolly Roger" is an English corruption of "Ali Raja," supposedly a 17th century Tamil pirate. Yet another theory is that it was taken from a nickname for the devil, "Old Roger".[10] The "jolly" appellation may be derived from the apparent grin of a skull.""
