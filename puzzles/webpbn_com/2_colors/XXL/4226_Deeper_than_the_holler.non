description "Randy Travis Well I've heard those city singers singin' 'bout how they can love Deeper than the oceans Higher than the stars above Well I come from the country and I know I ain't seen it all But I heard that oceans salty and the stars they sometimes fall And that would not do justice to the way I feel for you So I had to sing a song about all the things I knew My love is deeper than the holler Stronger than the river Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December And honest as a robin on the springtime window sill And longer than the song of a whippoorwill From the backroads to the broadway shows with a million miles between There's at least a million love songs that people love to sing And everyone is different And everyone's the same And this is just another way Of sayin' the same thing My love is deeper than the holler Stronger than the river Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December And honest as a robin on the springtime window sill And longer than the song of a whippoorwill My love is deeper than the holler Stronger than the river Higher than the pine trees growin' tall upon the hill My love is purer than the snowflakes that fall in late December And honest as a robin on the springtime window sill And longer than the song of a whippoorwill A whippoorwill"
