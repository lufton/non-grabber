description "I bought an unusual home-crafted bug repellent at a farmer's market that really works and doesn't smell bad. Unfortunately my cat loves to lick it off me. It contains catnip, which is known to repel bugs. I asked the inventor next time I went to the market if it would be bad for the cat, and she said it would be fine but most cats don't care for it because it doesn't have much catnip in it. I guess I just have a catnip junky!"
