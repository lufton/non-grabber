description "I'll give everyone a hint because it has been complained that there are too many movie titles to guess. Almost every one that I have published are Top 100 all time movies. Either that, or they are very recognizable pop culture. If I deem a title obscure, I will certainly give a hint. It isn;t the title, it IS the artist. Once again, WINNER receives ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!"
