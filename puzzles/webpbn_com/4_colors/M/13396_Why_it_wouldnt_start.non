description "My husband (aka the Engine Whisperer) went to fix our neighbor's lawnmower. The mower had been outdoors all winter, parked beneath a hickory tree. Turns out that the the nooks and crannnies around the motor were filled with hickory nuts. After that, the engine started right up. Wait! Something is burning. Oh, it's only more hickory nuts -- roasting in the exhaust pipe! That was full too. Moral: don't leave your lawnmower outside during the winter or if you do, don't park near a squirrel who is expecting a rough winter."
