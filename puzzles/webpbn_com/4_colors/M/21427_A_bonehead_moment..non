description "It's Thanksgiving and we're playing our hated rivals. To show camaraderie the band directors decided to present a united front and have both bands standing side by side under the goal posts playing the Star Spangle Banner. When we were finished we were to march down the field until even with our seats, then turn and march to our seats. Everyone except Norma, that is. A bee hovered right in front of my face, and instead of turning I focused my attention on the bee and continued marching straight ahead. All by myself."
