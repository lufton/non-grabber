description "Absolutely nothing! Not even air! My husband's brother's fiancÃ© has been staying at our house every weekend for a while now because she lives an hour away but goes to church where we live. One night after we'd gone to our respective rooms, we heard a loud "boom!" in the other room. My husband jokingly said, "I bet she broke something." I said, "No, I bet she just knocked over the box fan." A few seconds later she knocked on our door. I opened it and she said, "Uh, I think I broke your bed..." Sure enough! The sideboard broke from the bracket holding it on the headboard. We still haven't fixed it, so our guest bed is sitting on the floor!"
