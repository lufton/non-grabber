description "Since Destyny has made a puzzle. She made this puzzle of a cat this morning before going off to school. I was busy getting their school bags together and didn't even realize she was on webpbn until she screamed at me " Dad come see what I made". I told her it was cool and that I would publish it. Of course I made sure it was solvable first. Destyny is now 7 yrs old and is way smart. But I'm a bit biased.lol. Hope you all enjoy her efforts."
