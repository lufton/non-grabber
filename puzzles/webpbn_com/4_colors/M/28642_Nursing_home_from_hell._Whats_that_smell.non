description "While all of the meals were really, really bad there was one that could have won an award for the worst meal ever prepared. My roommate and I were lying on our beds waiting for dinner when we became aware if something that smelled really bad. When they walked in the room with our trays, we both came close to gagging. A nurse walked in the room with a tissue over her nose and mouth and said, "I see you're having their famous hot dogs and beans." I pushed my serving table as far away as I could and began leaning on the call button to get somebody to remove the ghastly mess."
