description "We saw Theo circulating through the crowd. Ellie whispered, "He's a doctor, for God's sake. Why couldn't he figure out what was wrong with her?" Fran had told me she was in pain a lot of the time in her muscles and deep in her bones. She had to drag herself to the bathroom. For a while, she seemed to be getting better, then her heart stopped, just like that. I saw the ambulance come, and the police. She was dead when they got there. "I think she went to another doctor--maybe more than one. They didn't know either. It wasn't just him." "Right." I grabbed Ellie's elbow and steered her back toward the dessert table. There were the most delicious little almond things and some cheesecake mini tarts. They were going fast. We saw Theo headed our way. "Thank you, thank you so much for coming," he said with a sad-eyed smile, hugging me. I patted his back. "Of course we came," said Ellie. He turned to her. She crossed her arms over her chest. "Theo, I'm so sorry." "Thank you. It was so sudden, just when she was getting--" He started to reach his arms out to her and she took a step back. "The ceremony was lovely," I said. "Just what Fran would have wanted." He smiled again, his head tilted to one side. I hated Theo's smile."
