description "My first ever puzzle was titled "needs luck and skill." It was of a 7-10 split, and I put a lot of black in the background because bowling pins were white. Here the bowling ball is trying to hit the 4-pin on its side, and maybe it will slide just right. The one red dot is slightly scuffed so there is no guessing. I still have things I want to do better but I thought I'd sort of revisit it after googling what was the hardest split to pick up. It's not Snake Eyes (the 7-10 split) as I thought, but the Greek Church (4-6-7-8-10 or 4-6-7-9-10). You have to be very unlucky or roll the ball very slowly and straight, and probably hit the 1-pin head on, to get it."
