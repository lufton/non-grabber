description "The next night, Mrs. Raccoon shows back up. My husband opens the front door. Mrs. Raccoon leaps off the porch into the flower bed and lands on top of the hidden Mama Cat and her kittens. Mama Cat leaps up and attacks Mrs. Raccoon, digging 20 claws into her back and biting her head. My husband said he had never seen a raccoon run that fast. Mama Cat wins!"
