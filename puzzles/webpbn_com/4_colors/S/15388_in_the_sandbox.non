description "a spray bottle to "set" castles. My son once had a sand box (a deep plastic bin) in his room for therapeutic reasons; it helped him relax when his anxiety level got too high. Then he added a lot of water to make an ocean. That was ok as the bin was deep enough. Then he made a tsunami wave that ended up on the carpet. So we dumped the sand out into the back yard. Then the dog thought it was his personal beach and would lay in the sand every day."
